# Machine_Learning_Notebooks

- This repository contains a **collection of Jupyter notebooks developed during the Machine Learning course of the master's degree program.**  
The notebooks include practical exercises, examples, and implementations of supervised and unsupervised algorithms, generative models, and representation techniques.

- Each notebook is designed to explore fundamental concepts through real-world cases or educational datasets, and includes both code and visualizations.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

These notebooks were developed during the early stages of my learning journey.  
I chose to keep them as a record of the evolution of my understanding of core ML concepts.  
The content may be updated or expanded in the future.
